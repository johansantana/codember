# Challenge 4: Dude, I lost my password

## Problem

A friend bought 5 BitCoins in 2008. The problem is that he had it in a digital wallet... and he doesn't remember the password!

He asked us for help. And he gave us some clues:

- It's a 5-digit password.
- The password has the number 5 repeated twice.
- The number to the right is always greater than or equal to the one on the left.

He gave us some examples:

- 55678 is correct, it fulfills everything
- 12555 is correct, it fulfills everything
- 55555 is correct, it fulfills everything
- 12345 is incorrect, it does not have the 5 repeated.
- 57775 is incorrect, the numbers do not go in increasing order

He says that the password is between the numbers 11098 and 98123. Can we tell him how many numbers fulfill those rules within that range?
